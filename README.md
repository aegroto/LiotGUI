# JMEAndroid Template

This an Android Project boilerplate for a game built on [**JMonkeyEngine**] (https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/) using gradle. It includes only base libraries,the JMonkeyEngine's BasicGame project,any more specific setting should be configure by yourself to satisfy your needs.

This is home-made. Released under [**Zlib-libpng license**] (https://tldrlegal.com/license/zlib-libpng-license-(zlib) . I provide this software without any warranty. If you find bugs,report it with an issue or just fix it and send a pull request (the second would be better :) ).

## Booting
This boilerplate is [**BootMonkey**] (https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/bootmonkey-bootstrap-your-jme-project/37141) - ready so you can create any android game project with this template just using this awesome tool. Anyway,you can even just clone the repository and configure it as you please.

## Other/Known Issues
0. The BootMonkey configuration still doesn't set the name of your Android App. If you want to set a custom name (and you'll probably want),just edit the file "src/main/res/values/strings.xml". Default name is MyGame.
